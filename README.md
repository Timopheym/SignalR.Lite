SignalR.Lite
============
A lightweight version of SignalR that serves as a learning tool for how the real framework actually works. 

It shows the following:

- The new HttpTaskAsyncHandler in .NET 4.5.
- A very naive and basic in memory message bus implementation.
- Server Sent events and LongPolling transport implementations on the server and client.
- Transport fallback on the client side.
